This website project is to create an online shopping website for Home accessories. I created Home page and other pages of the website: About Us, Bedroom, Bathroomm, Home Decor, News,... and apply knowledge learned so far in the course
to design the website page: CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, Database,....
For the HD Task, I added an advanced feature for the website: Let people register an account, hash their password to protect their privacy and verify their validity of login details. I use Bcrypt library in Nodejs to hash password, 
create a database with Sqlite3 to store data of users.
